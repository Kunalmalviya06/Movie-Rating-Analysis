# Movie Rating Analysis (Rotten Tomato)

This project is a comprehensive analysis of over 15,000 films reviewed between 1914 and 2019. It delves into various aspects of movie ratings, genres, audience feedback, release trends, and factors influencing the success of films based on both Tomatometer and Audience scores. Several business concepts, such as market segmentation, consumer behavior analysis, pricing strategy, customer satisfaction, and risk analysis, have been applied to gain insights from the data.
